Microservice template using microsoft latest .Net 5

#TODO: Explain
* Microservices

   The microservices architecture takes this same approach and extends it to the loosely coupled services which can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Each of   these services is responsible for a discrete task and can communicate with other services through simple APIs to solve a larger complex business problem. The services are independent of each other and run in their own processes.
